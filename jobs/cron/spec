    description: A key-value map of environment variables that should be set in the crontab
    example:
      PATH: /var/vcap/package/mypackage/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
      HOME: /home/vcap
  cron.entries:
    description: |
      A list of key-value objects representing cron entries. Each entry must contain
      properties for 'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'month', 'wday', 'user', and 'command'. These
      properties are directly injected into the crontab, and should follow cron syntax
      conventions.

      If command is specified, that path is executed by cron and must already exist.
      If script is specified, the contents of that key are written out to disk and executed by cron.

      If command and script are specified for the same entry, the contents of script will be executed, and command ignored
    example:
    - command: /var/vcap/packages/mypackage/bin/myhourlyscript
      script:
        name: touch.sh
